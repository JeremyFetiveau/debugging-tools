- [v8-doar-helpers](https://github.com/JeremyFetiveau/debugging-tools/tree/master/v8_doare-helpers) adds a `%DumpObjects` command to `v8` that you can use from Javascript. It will display an annotated memory dump starting from a given JS object allowing you to easily see what kind of objects are located in memory.
